# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the reason, that this Command Line Tool is mainly
used on my machine, I only support the newest Version with Security and
Feature Updates.
If you still use this Tool and want to use an older Version, but find a Bug,
please contact the Contributer or create an Issue


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a Vulnerability, I would be happy
if you created an Issue to tell me what you found.
